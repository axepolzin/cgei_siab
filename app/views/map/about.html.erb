<h2>about</h2>
<p>This project attempts to study land ownership patterns on Chicago's South Side by examining publicly available property tax data.</p>


<h3>definitions</h3>
<div>
<ul>Owner-occupied: Registered Tax Address = Property Address</ul>
<ul>Speculation: Count of numbers associated with each tax address</ul>
<ul>Local Ownership: Tax address within zip code</ul>
<ul>Taxpayer:	Could refer to individual or corporate entity. Based off tax address because name values are unreliable.</ul>


<h3>methodology</h3>
<ul>1 Scraped Property Data from http://www.cookcountypropertyinfo.com/Pages/PIN-Results.aspx
Using reference list Cook County GIS parcel data pins 2014.</ul>

<ul>2 Standardized data using Google Maps API</ul>

<ul>3 Mapped:	Occupancy and	Ownership Trends (Locality, Concentration)</ul>


<h3>notes on the data</h3>
<ul>1 2014 property pins available from https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/GIS-Maps/ccgisdata-Lot-2014/2vjk-wpfr</ul>
<ul>2 More up-to-date property info available from http://162.217.184.82/i2/default.aspx</ul>
<br/>
<p>For purposes of project limited to study of Hyde Park Township due to query limitations of the free version of Google Maps API</p>


Data set: 2292 entries
</p>

<h3>next steps</h3>
<h4>analysis</h4>
	<ul>Add dimensions for custom geographic area</ul>
<ul>Look at all of Chicago</ul>

<h4>visualization</h4>
	<ul>Use shapefile data to map lots</ul>


<h5>data</h5>
	<ul>Update with more recent data</ul>
	<ul>Ownership currently includes all rental units in building â€“ fix this</ul>
	<ul>Create boolean filter based on name</ul>
